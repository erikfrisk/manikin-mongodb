Test with and without inverseName on many-to-many relations.

100% coverage

The kinds of tests that have been written for sally should be applied directly to this layer.

Get rid of all x-owner and x-indirect-owner in the mongoose data - that information should be fetched from meta instead!

All operations that can leave the data in an invalid state should use two-phase commits and be tested for that.

There are at least three features that have not been tested:
* Validation in "nullablesValidation"
* Cascade in "preRemoveCascadeNullable" (should work by removing as hasOne indrectly, by deleteing an owner for example)
* Uniques
